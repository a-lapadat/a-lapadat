## **About Me** <br>
I am a third-year student at Amherst College, majoring in Neuroscience with a strong focus on biostatistics and data science. My fascination lies in understanding the complexities of the brain and exploring how artificial intelligence can bridge gaps in our knowledge of neurological systems. From developing predictive machine learning models for neurodegenerative diseases to designing advanced neurotechnologies, I am passionate about harnessing the power of AI for healthcare.

## **Academic & Research Background** <br>
With a solid foundation in computer programming and statistics, I aim to integrate my technical skills into real-world applications in healthcare. During my time at Amherst and through internships at the Barrow Neurological Institute (Summer 2023) and the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute (Summer 2024), I honed my proficiency in Python, R, STATA, and Bash scriptingâ€”essential tools for my work in biostatistics and data science.

## **Key Achievements** <br>
One of my proudest accomplishments was delivering an oral presentation at the American Academy of Neurology 2024 Annual Meeting in Denver. My project, titled _"Application of Simazine, Atrazine, and Lindane Pesticides Are Associated with Incident Parkinson's Disease Risk in the Rocky Mountain Region,"_ highlighted the connection between pesticide exposure and Parkinson's disease.

In addition to my passion for the natural and formal sciences, I enjoy expanding my knowledge in philosophy, history, and archaeology, fostering a well-rounded intellectual curiosity.
