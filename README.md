## **About Me** <br>
I'm a senior at Amherst College majoring in neuroscience, with a strong interest in statistics, its underlying theory, data analysis, GIS, and their tangible applications in public health and healthcare. I'm particularly passionate about biostatistics and epidemiology, which represent, for me, the perfect combination between quantitative thinking and the opportunity to bring meaningful, positive change in people's lives.

## **Academic & Research Background** <br>
My academic and research experiences span summer internships at WashU's Department of Neurology, the Barrow Neurological Institute, and the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, as well as ongoing biostatistics research during the academic year. These opportunities have helped me define my career mission: to improve global health through data-driven research. 

Over the past few years, I've developed and applied skills in Python, R, STATA, and Bash, working on projects ranging from pesticide exposure and Parkinson's disease risk to genomic data analysis in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

## **Key Achievements** <br>
A highlight of my undergraduate career was presenting my research at the 2024 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in Denver. My talk, "Application of Simazine, Atrazine, and Lindane Pesticides Are Associated with Incident Parkinson's Disease Risk in the Rocky Mountain Region," was my first oral conference presentation, and an experience that affirmed my passion for research.

## **Future Plans** <br>
After graduation, I plan to explore different research paths either in academia or the industry before committing to a PhD in epidemiology or biostatistics, though I'm also curious about adjacent areas like bioethics, neurotechnology, and global health. I search for work environments where I'm constantly pushed to learn more, from new programming techniques and statistical concepts to disease mechanisms, and where I can collaborate and discuss my work with others who share my passions. 

## **Let's Connect!** <br>
Beyond the natural and formal sciences, I love learning about paleontology (I've been a docent at my college's natural history museum since my first semester!), philosophy, history, and the ethical use of AI. Feel free to reach out if you're working on an interdisciplinary project or think I'd be interested in something you're exploring.
